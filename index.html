                <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
                <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Information Technology. 
                I love Jesus, sports, hanging out with friends, and pizza!</p>
                <p>I love getting to know more and more people as I continue my college career. 
                I love to help in various outreach ministries and discipleship groups. I also enjoy watching and participating in any kind of sports in my spare time.
                       I also have a great burden for missions, being a missionary myself and being exposed to many different countries really molded that.</p>
